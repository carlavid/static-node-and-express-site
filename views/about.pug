            | Determined to forge my own path, I embarked on a self-guided journey of learning, actively seeking resources and programs tailored for women of color in the tech industry. This ultimately led me to the prestigious Intuit and AnitaB Apprenticeship Pathway Program. Currently I am working through Treehouse's JavaScript Full Stack Techdegree, eagerly preparing for my role as a Software Engineer Apprentice at Intuit, starting this January.

I love a good challenge, and I'm excited about the creative thinking this industry encourages. Being a Latina, I'm also looking forward to contributing my unique perspective to enrich and diversify the tech space.

# Static Node.js and Express Site
## Unit 6 Project for the Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree

This project uses JavaScript, Node.js, Express and Pug templates to create a portfolio site that showcases all the Treehouse projects I've worked on so far. 

Extra credit features: 
* Customized package.json file so that running "npm start" will run the app.
* Created two new Pug templates in the views folder that will be rendered when there's a 404 error or other status error.
* Style changes:
    * Added glow effect when users hovers over project thumbnails on the homepage
    * Added animation when user clicks on project thumbnail page
    * Added box shadow and color change when user hovers over links
